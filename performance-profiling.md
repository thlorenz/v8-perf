# General Strategies to track and improve Performance

## Identify and Understand Performance Problem

[watch](http://youtu.be/UJPdhx5zTaw?t=40m1s) | [slide](http://v8-io12.appspot.com/index.html#83)
[watch profiling workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=40m50s)

Analyse performance only once you have a problem in a top down manner like so:

- ensure it's JavaScript and not the DOM
- reduce testcase to pure JavaScript and run in `v8` shell
- collect metrics and locate bottlenecks
- sample profiling to narrow down the general problem area
  - at this point think about the algorithm, data structures, techniques, etc. used in this area and evaluate if
    improvements in this area are possible since that will most likely yield greater impact than any of the more fine
    grained improvments
- structural profiling to isolate the exact area i.e. function in which most time is spent
  - evaluate what can be improved here again thinking about algorithm first
  - *only once* algorithm and data structures seem optimal evaluate how the code structure affects assembly code generated by v8 and
    possible optimizations (small functions, `try/catch`, closures, loops vs. `forEach`, etc.)
- optimize slowest section of code and repeat structural profiling

## Sampling CPU Profilers

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=3m20s)
[watch walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=34m00s)

- at fixed frequency program is instantaneously paused *by setting stacksize to 0* and the call stack sampled
- assumes that the sample is representative of workload
- gives no sense fo flow to due gaps between samples
- functions that were inlined by compiler aren't shown
- collect data for longer period of time, sampling every 1ms
- ensure code is exercising the right code paths

## Structural CPU Profilers

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=7m10s)
[watch walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=37m10s)

- functions are instrumented to record entry and exit times
- three data points per function
  - **Inclusive Time**: time spent in function *including* its children
  - **Exclusive Time**: time spent in function *excluding* its children
  - **Call Count**: number of times the functino was called
- data points are taken at much higher frequency than sampling
- higher cost than sampling dut to instrumentation
- goal of optimization is to **minimize inclusive time**
- inlined functions retain markers

### Instrumentation Techniques

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=46m10s)

- think about data being processed 
  - is one piece of data slower?
- name time ranges based on data
  - use variables/properties to dynamically name ranges


## Instrumenting vs. Sampling

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=10m30s)

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                   |      Sampling          |    Structural / Instrumenting |
|-----------------------------------+------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Time                              |       Approximate      |            Exact              |
| Invocation count                  |       Approximate      |            Exact              |
| Overhead                          |       Small            |            High(er)           |
| Accuracy                          |       Good - Poor      |            Good - Poor        |
| Extra code / instrumentation      |       No               |            Yes                |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- need both
- manual instrumentation can reduce overhead
- instrumentation affects performance and may affect behavior
- samples are very accurate, but inaccurate for extacting time
- samping requires no program modification

## Plan for Performance

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=47m50s)

- each module of app sould have time budget
- sum of modules should be `< 16ms` for smooth client side apps
- track performance daily or per commit in order to catch *budget busters* right away

## Animation Frame

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=50m00s)
[watch walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=52m20s)

- queue up key handlers and execute inside Animation Frame
- optimize for lowest common denominator that your app will run on
- for mobile stay below `8-10ms` since remaining time is needed for chrome to do its work, i.e. render

# v8 Performance Profiling

## Chrome Devtools Profiler

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=15m00s)

- *Profile Tab -> Start -> Record Sample*
- tree view gives idea of flow (call stack) and allows drilling into tree nodes
- save profiles to load them later i.e. for bug reports
- use [octane benchmark](http://octane-benchmark.googlecode.com/svn/latest/index.html) to experiment with the profiler

## Chrome Tracing aka chrome://tracing

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=17m55s)

- access at [chrome://tracing](chrome://tracing/)
- hidden feature like [`chrome://memory`](chrome://memory) originally designed *by chrome developers for chrome developers*
- view into guts of what chrome is doing
- timeline of what code is doing framed in larger chrome context
- allows optimizing low level gpu performance

### Preparation

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=20m10s)

- instrument code
  - a) manually add calls to `console.time` and `console.timeEnd` with a unique `name` as argument to mark entry and exit points of an
    area in the code
  - b) Firefox does automatic instrumentation via Firebug (Chrome's Profiler is sample based, while Firebug's is structural)
  - c) use compiler/automatic tool to add calls
  - d) use runtime instrumentation, similar to valgrind in C
- instrumentation archieved via trace macros
  - can be nested (hierarchy reflected in profiling display)
  - when turned off cost at most a few dozen clocks
  - when turned on cost a few thousand clocks (0.01ms)
  - arguments passed to macro are only computed when macro is enabled
- `time/timeEnd` spam dev tools console (keep it closed)
- in order to easily remove macro in production wrap `time/timeEnd` calls

### Running

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=24m45s)

- close all other tabs in order to have the least noise caused by other tabs and thus get cleaner samples
- `|Record|` to start recording a trace
- switch to app and interact with it, limit this to 10s as buffer gets large very quickly
- switch back `|Stop Tracing|`
- `|Save| / |Load|` trace

### Evaluation

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=27m00s)

- data includes lots of noise since each tab/process will include activity from the following pieces:
  - IO thread
  - renderer thread
  - compositor thread
- find pid of your page via [`chrome://memory`](chrome://memory)

#### Filter for Signal

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=28m35s)

- in order to get nice timeline
- remove unnec. threads and components by selecting only rows with your pid
- filter by categories, v8 and webkit are most relevant for JS profiling

### Inspect

[watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxXkquTPng8&feature=share&t=30m00s)

- navigation based on quake keys and is not mouse friendly, although it seems to be improving

```
                  +---+
                  | W | zoom in
+---+             +---+           +---+               +---+
| A | pan left    | S | zoom out  | D | pan right     | ? |  help (other shortcuts)
+---+             +---+           +---+               +---+
```

### Resources

- [trace-viewer](https://code.google.com/p/trace-viewer/) supports streaming trace data over web sockets
- [trace event format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/edit) JSON format
  to allow interfacing with other tools
- [web tracing framework](http://google.github.io/tracing-framework/) an alternative to the built in tracer
- [about:tracing](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool)

## v8 tools

- ship with v8 source code
- **plot-time-events**: generates `png` showing v8 timeline
- **(mac|linux|windows)-tick-processor**: generates table of functions sorted by time spent in them


## Using Chrome

### v8 timeline

#### Capturing

[watch](http://youtu.be/VhpdsjBUS3g?t=24m26s)

```sh
Chrome --no-sandbox --js-flags="--prof --noprof-lazy --log-timer-events"

[ .. ]

tools/plot-timer-events /chrome/dir/v8.log
```

#### Analyzing

[watch](http://youtu.be/VhpdsjBUS3g?t=25m00s)

##### Top Band

- `v8.GCScavenger` young generation collection
- `v8.Execute` executing JavaScript
- scavenges interrupt script execution

#### Middle Band

- shows code kind
- bright green - optimized
- blue/purple - unoptimized

#### Bottom Graph

- shows pauses
- lots in beginning since scripts are being parsed
- no pauses when running optimized code
- scavenges (top band) correllate with pause time spikes

### Finding Slow Running Unoptimized Functions

[watch](http://youtu.be/VhpdsjBUS3g?t=27m55s)

```sh
Chrome --no-sandbox --js-flags="--prof --noprof-lazy --log-timer-events"

[ .. ]

tools/mac-timer-events /chrome/dir/v8.log
```

[watch](http://youtu.be/UJPdhx5zTaw?t=42m33s) | [slide](http://v8-io12.appspot.com/index.html#88)

- generates table of functions sorted by time spent in them
- includes C++ functions
- `*` indicates optimized functions
- functions without `*` could not be optimized

#### d8

[watch](http://youtu.be/UJPdhx5zTaw?t=40m53s) | [slide](http://v8-io12.appspot.com/index.html#84)

```sh
/v8/out/native/d8 test.js --prof
```

### Determining why a Function was not Optimized

[watch](http://youtu.be/VhpdsjBUS3g?t=29m00s)
[watch](http://youtu.be/UJPdhx5zTaw?t=39m30s) | [slide](http://v8-io12.appspot.com/index.html#81)

```sh
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --no-sandbox --js-flags="--trace-deopt --trace-opt-verbose --trace-bailout"

[ . lots of other output. ]

[disabled optimization for xxx, reason: The Reason why function couldn't be optimized]
```

- lots of output which is best piped into file and evaluated
- especially watch out for deoptimized functions with lots of arithmetic operations

#### d8

[watch](http://youtu.be/UJPdhx5zTaw?t=35m12s) | [slide](http://v8-io12.appspot.com/index.html#69)

```sh
d8 --trace-opt
```

Log optimizing compiler bailouts:

[watch](http://youtu.be/UJPdhx5zTaw?t=36m24s) | [slide](http://v8-io12.appspot.com/index.html#73)

```sh
d8 --trace-bailout
```

Log deoptimizations:


[watch](http://youtu.be/UJPdhx5zTaw?t=39m12s) | [slide](http://v8-io12.appspot.com/index.html#80)

```sh
d8 --trace-deopt
```

#### Improvments

- don't use construct that caused function to be deoptimized
- or move all code inside construct into separate function and call it instead
